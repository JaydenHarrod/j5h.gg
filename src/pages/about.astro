        <p>Hi, I'm Jayden ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>A self-taught web developer from Australia that enjoys creating digital products.</p>
        <p>
          In high school, I monetised my own YouTube brand and recieved sponsorships with Lenovo. I picked up skills in video production, infrastructure, and digital marketing prior to leaving high school. From there, I worked as a videographer and content creator in Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a pivot to web development in 2016 and have been working in the industry ever since. I've worked on a variety of projects from small websites to large scale enterprise applications. I've worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, but I've found myself gravitating towards React and Node.js.
